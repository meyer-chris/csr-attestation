I wouldn't object to a change to zero or one, but I would to \"exactly one\".

HSMs that already support ASN.1/DER likely will object to some other encoding (e.g., CBOR), but environments that are already capable of CBOR may object to ASN.1/DER etc. Given there are use cases for CSRs originating from various environments such as DICE Protection Environment (DPE), SPDM Responders, and embedded uControllers (but not HSMs). Given there can be layers of compute that may issue a CSR, the CSR draft should be flexible toward accommodating industry evolution and trends rather than serve to constrain or limit such evolution.",

The reason for this is that the evidence might contain detailed information about hardware and patch levels of the device on which the private key resides. Certificates are considered public information. The certificate requester has consented to sharing this detailed device information with the CA but might not consent to having them published.\r\n> These privacy considerations are beyond the scope of this document and may require additional signaling mechanisms in the CSR to prevent unintended publication of sensitive information, so we leave it as \"NOT RECOMMENDED\".",

Interesting idea that the CSR could also carry an Attestation Result. But I'm struggling to imagine how that would work; for example an RA could not replace the Evidence with an Attestation Result without breaking the signature on the CSR.",

If the verifier (operated by the HSM manufacturer, or their representative) needs to communicate things other than pass/fail with the RP (the CA), then they need a different protocol.\r\n\r\nI expect we'll see a lot of \"Pass/Fail for a given evidence verification profile\" (or whatever the right RATS term is for that). Like \"Does this CSR indicate compliance with CA/B BRs?\", or \"Did this CSR come from TPM-backed CAPI on a fully-patched Windows?\". Or maybe even, the CA hands the verifier a list of evidence verification profiles (maybe each with its own trust store), and the Verifier hands back a list of profiles that this CSR complies with, the CA then smacks the corresponding OIDs on the cert.",

Like \"Does this CSR indicate compliance with CA/B BRs?\", or \"Did this CSR come from TPM-backed CAPI on a fully-patched Windows?\". Or maybe even, the CA hands the verifier a list of evidence verification profiles (maybe each with its own trust store), and the Verifier hands back a list of profiles that this CSR complies with, the CA then smacks the corresponding OIDs on the cert.\r\n\r\nSure, but none of those messages can go INTO the CSR. Because it's signed by the Attester, and the Verifier can't modify that.\r\nRATS does not define a protocol between RP and Verifier: we have to pick one or design one.\r\nYour initial proposal that it's a proprietary popen(\"|hsm-manufacturer-module\") is probably a good one for now.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
