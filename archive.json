HSMs that already support ASN.1/DER likely will object to some other encoding (e.g., CBOR), but environments that are already capable of CBOR may object to ASN.1/DER etc. Given there are use cases for CSRs originating from various environments such as DICE Protection Environment (DPE), SPDM Responders, and embedded uControllers (but not HSMs). Given there can be layers of compute that may issue a CSR, the CSR draft should be flexible toward accommodating industry evolution and trends rather than serve to constrain or limit such evolution.",
